Flutter pet project

I took the Chat Journal application as a basis and
tried to make its basic functionality with a slightly
modified design. In the application, you can create
different categories of notes and add messages to
them. Messages may contain pictures or photo.
I also added the ability to search for a message,
forward it to another category and add events to
"favorites". All data is stored in Firebase realtime
database. As a state manager, I used BloC Cubit.
All application settings are stored locally in shared
preferences. The app also supports dark and light
theme. Each new user logs in to the application
anonymously.
